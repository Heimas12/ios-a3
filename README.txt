The project our group made is a movie ticket subscription software for mobile phones. The advantage of the software we make is that it is quick to operate, so the target audience is mainly those who suddenly want to watch movies without making relevant schedules in advance. The problems we have solved so far mainly include the login and registration of the software account, the layout of the movie homepage, how to quickly cancel the movie reservation, and create a new way of seat selection by using the scroll wheel.

In the zip file compressed by our project, click on the file MovieTickets.xcworkspace to run it to see our program.
